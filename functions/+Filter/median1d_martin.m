%MEDIAN1D_MARTIN Performs a median filter
%   this functions does the same thing like MEDIAN1D_CPP. The only
%   difference is that it does not produce an output array but writes the
%   filtered data directly in the input array. This is made for filtering
%   extremely big arrays to avoid the doubling of the necessary RAM.
